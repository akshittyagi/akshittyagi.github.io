<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I am a fourth-year undergraduate student in the department of <a href="http://www.ee.iitd.ac.in">Electrical Engineering</a> at the <a href="http://www.iitd.ac.in">Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi</a>. Before coming here, I was a high-school student at <a href="http://www.dpsrkp.net/">Delhi Public School, R.K.Puram</a>.

<p> My work lies in the area of Deep Learning applied to solving(or trying to solve) NLP problems. As part of my undergraduate thesis I am working with
  <a href="http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~mausam">Prof. Mausam</a> on using Open Information Extraction for Fact Based Question Answering. In the Summer of 2017,
  I worked with <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/sumit-negi-47262413">Sumit Negi</a> at Amazon for developing a word embedding based moderation pipeline for advertisements on the Amazon Marketplace.
<p>Apart from my academic pursuits I am fascinated by aviation and also I like playing the drums.</p>

<h2>Major Projects and Internships</h2>

<ol>
    <li><h4> OpenIE(Open Information Extraction) for Fact Based Question Answering </h4>
      I am currently working on using OpenIE to extract meaningful tuples out of a knowledge base to be used for answering 4th-8th grade science based factoidal questions.
      This work is built on top of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.05572.pdf">Answering Complex Questions Using Open Information Extraction</a>

      </li>
      <br>
      

<li><h4> WordVector Based Moderation Pipeline for Amazon Marketplace </h4>
We developed an end-to-end distributed pipeline for scoring the risk factor of a specific advertisment campaign on the Amazon Marketplace. This uses the text description of the ad and the associated photograph.
Using these two, we developed a feature extractor to encode the risk of the advertisement and then use an ensemble of regressors to give the majority score of the advertisment. This was used in conjunction with the manual moderation team to make it
more efficient for them to score only those ads on which our pipeline wasn't confident enough.
</li>
<br>

<li><h4> Minimax Bot for playing the game of <a href="http://cheapass.com/tak/">Tak</a></h4>
The created bot uses Minimax to search over all the possible set of game states, and selects the best ones using a utility function. The utility function has been trained by seeing which features affect the quality of gameplay the most. The code and a description of the strategy used can be found <a href="https://github.com/akshittyagi/TakBot">here</a>
</li>
<br>

<li> <h4>Using Genetic Algorithms for approximately solving the Traveling Salesman Problem</h4>
  A specific tour of the travelling salesman was modelled as a gene for the Genetic Algorithm(GA). This gene was then mutated using two different crossover techniques: CX and PMX; and both the types of offsprings were included in the final population for the next generation.
  Fitness of a gene was the Laplace smoothened reciprocal of the total distance of the tour. The crossover process was parallelised thus allowing for very large starting populations and also made the GA approach the maxima in a small number of iterations.
  For more on the algorithm and the code go <a href="https://github.com/akshittyagi/tsp">here</a>.
</li>
  <br>
  

<li> <h4>Local Search Algorithms with Parallelization</h4>
Implemented a set of Local Search algorithms including: HillClimibingWithRandomRestarts, HillClimbingwithTabu, BeamSearch,
BeamSearchWithTabu and BeamSearchWithRandomRestarts. This is used to search for the global maxima for the cost of a resource allocation problem. Parallelization was done to introduce three threads to update a common max value, to make searching more time efficient. The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/akshittyagi/TowerAllocationusingAI">here</a>
</li>
<br>

<li> <h4>Echo State Networks for Stock Prediction</h4>
We use an Echo State Network or a reservoir RNN for capturing the movement of a specific stock. The echo state network takes in the input as the stock price of the previous day, the learned state of the echo state network and outputs the predicted value of the index on the current day. The code for the ESN can be found <a href="https://github.com/akshittyagi/StockPred">here</a>
</li>

<h2>Other Projects and Apps</h2>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Sparse Matrix Vector Multiplication</h4>
    Built a parallelised module for multiplying a sparse matrix with a dense vector. This use case is commmonly seen in Deep Learning libraries with vector calculus dictating many of the matrices in use to be sparse.
    The Matrix was represented as a Compressed Sparse Row(CSR), and the calculations were henceforth parallelised for the dot product. Using CUDA allowed for device level and global level data and functionality separation.
    Code can be found <a href="https://github.com/akshittyagi/sparseMatVecMul">here</a>.
  </li>
  <br>

  <li><h4>Physics Engine for a Simulator Game</h4>
   Built a C# application for the universal Windows environment. We designed a PhysX Engine from scratch for a space simulator with gravity and multi-partilce interactions. This was packaged as game and won the Runners Up at Microsoft's Code.Fun.Do hackathon.
   Choosing to develop a customised PhysX Engine over Unity gave us more speed and resulted in a smoother user experience. Code for this app can be found <a href="https://github.com/akshittyagi/beynew">here</a>.
   You can also see a demo video <a href="./files/Level5timeout.mp4">here</a>.
  </li>
  <br>

  <li><h4>Android application for Moodle</h4>
    We developed an android app for the learning management system used at IIT Delhi- Moodle. This was done as an assignment as proof-of-concept for porting the moodle system to a mobile-friendly environment. web2py was used for the server-side handling of the users and their registration and modification of data. Code can be found <a href="https://github.com/akshittyagi/MoodlePlus">here</a>.
